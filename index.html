    <h1>Ghanaian Akan Names Generator</h1>
</div>
<div>
    <p><br>Across many cultures in the world, naming of a person has always been informed by several factors. Some of
        them include the day of birth, time of the day one is born, season of the year or even after a certain
        personallity.</br><br>Here I have built an interactive program that interpretes and shows a name from the
        Ghanaian naming methods called Akan.</br> <br>Akan names are derived from Ghanaian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
        children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were
        born.</br><br>This program is designed to allow users check in their date and year of birth to get their Akan
        names.<br>Give it a try below. Simply input your date of birth and gender and see the magic. Enjoy the
        experience!!</p>
